gift from <strong>God</strong>.  I began by playing the oatmeal and grits boxes, after mama cooked the oatmeal and grits.  &nbsp;I also played my bed springs after pulling back the mattress of my bed. &nbsp;I later begin to play bongos and congos with <strong>Ray</strong> from 63rd street.</p><br> <p>I continued playing the drums at <strong>Christ Deliverance Center</strong> church, on 63rd and Kimbark. &nbsp;Later mama was able to buy me a drum set when we lived in 1132. &nbsp;I went on to purchase my own set after the original set that mama got for me were run through by a taffy apple stick, I found left in the drums. &nbsp;Then <strong>Alfred</strong>, my brother <strong>Greg</strong> and me began to form a group, in 1132, apt. 901.</p><br> <p>My brother <strong>Butchie</strong> and I, attended <strong>Coyne American Institute</strong> together 1978 thru 1979 school year. &nbsp;While there, I instructed Butchie and some of his classmates in electrical maintenance theory, because of my electrical/electronics major course of study at <strong>Martin Luther King</strong> high school, where I graduated in 1977. &nbsp;I graduated from Coyne in 1979.</p><br> <p>While in school at Coyne, I started working at downtown Chicago <strong>Marriott Hotel</strong>. &nbsp;Where my official career as a Maintenance Engineer began, three months before graduating from Coyne. &nbsp;After years of working at the Chicago Marriott Hotel, my brother Butchie and me worked together at <strong>Neair</strong>, a non profit organization. &nbsp;Where Butchie was very instrumental in aiding me in obtaining a job at Neair, as Electrical Maintenance Mechanic.</p><br> <p>Later, I went on to attend <strong>ITT Technical Institute</strong>, where I graduated with my Electronic Engineering Technology degree in September of 1999. &nbsp;After awhile, I was hired at <strong>Horseshoe Casino</strong> in Hammond, Indiana, as an Electronic Technician, and then on to <strong>Chicago Transit
